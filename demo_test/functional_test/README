'dm' is a command line wrapper of the test application 'demotest' serving the purpose of device-management API functional testing.

It runs on top of the device-management container and 'demotest' requiring the accessibility of at least 2 separate devices running RedFish servers and can be utilized in either automated or manual testing. Either way, the device-mangement container needs to have been deployed.

1. Test Automation
   Test cases utilizing 'dm' are provided in the tests/ sub-directory. They can be executed through either the Makefile is provided.

   a) Makefile
      At command line, type
	make test IP1=<ip of 1st device> PORT1=<RF port # of 1st device> IP2=<ip of 2nd device> PORT2=<RF port # of 2nd device> USER1=<user of 1st device> PWD1=<password of 1st device> USER2=<user of 2nd device> PWD2=<password of 2nd device>

2. Manual testing at command line
   To build 'dm', at command line, type
	make
   To run 'dm', please make and launch 'demotest' first then follow the syntax and examples below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
register one device
Example: Set IP 192.168.4.27 port 8888 freq 180
./dm attach 192.168.4.27:8888:180

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
register multiple devices
Example: Set "IP 192.168.4.27 port 8888 freq 180" and "IP 192.168.4.26 port 8888 freq 120"
./dm attach 192.168.4.27:8888:180 192.168.4.26:8888:120

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
detach devices
Example: Delete "IP 192.168.4.27" and "IP 192.168.3.34"
./dm detach 192.168.4.27:8888 192.168.4.26:8888

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Current List of Devices monitored
./dm showdevices
Sample output: 192.168.4.26:8888 192.168.4.27:8888

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change polling interval
Example:
Set frequecny to 30 seconds
./dm period 192.168.4.27:8888:30
